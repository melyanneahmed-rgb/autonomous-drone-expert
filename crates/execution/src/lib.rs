#![forbid(unsafe_code)]

//! # `ade-execution` — the single, non-bypassable outbound execution path (M1)
//!
//! Every outbound command of the lifecycle goes through [`Executor`]. There is no other
//! sanctioned way to reach a transport, and the executor's API is **typed only**: callers
//! choose a [`ReadOperation`] or a [`WriteOperation`] — never a raw frame, raw command byte
//! or arbitrary payload. Payload shapes are therefore correct by construction (all reads and
//! `MSP_EEPROM_WRITE`/`MSP_REBOOT` are empty; the beeper write is exactly four bytes).
//!
//! Before any exchange the executor checks, in order:
//! 1. the current [`SessionState`] permits the command's [`WriteCommandClass`];
//! 2. for a write/reboot: a [`WriteApproval`] is present and its target, class and recovery
//!    class each match the executor's target, the operation's class and the step's declared
//!    recovery class;
//! 3. the executor itself refuses to exist for [`ExecutionTarget::Hardware`], so a hardware
//!    exchange is unrepresentable before any transport is even opened.
//!
//! Every reply is validated strictly: decoded, direction-checked (`!` is a failure, never an
//! ACK), classified by the [`Correlator`] (duplicate/out-of-order/unsolicited replies are
//! typed errors), command-matched against the request, and — for writes — required to carry
//! an empty payload. Raw request/reply payloads are never logged; the transport's audit sink
//! records metadata only.
